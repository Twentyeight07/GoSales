## What is GoSales?  

GoSales is a **Sales System** that allows you to record new sales, manage your inventory, and generate sales reports.

********************************************

## How can you use this code?

To use this code, you need the following packages from NuGet:

+ AutoMapper
+ AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
+ DinkToPdf
+ FirebaseAuthentication.net
+ FirebaseStorage.net
+ Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
+ Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

Next, set up a DbContext

If you need help creating the database, you can find a text file with the entire DB creation script at *GoSales -> utilities -> DBCreate*. Simply run it in your Microsoft SQL Server Script prompt to create a DB Context. **Note: You need to manually create the "Notification" table to define the structure you want for your notifications**.

Run the following command in your NuGet Console:

        :::console
        Scaffold-DbContext "Data Source=(local)\SQLEXPRESS;
        Initial Catalog=TUDB;Integrated
        Security=True;Encrypt=False"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

*Note:* this command works for running a local server.

Where **Initial Catalog** specify your DB name and if you're not using Integrated Security, you'll need to provide a **User Id** and **Password** to LogIn.

## Notifications

The notification system was developed by me and shows when a new sale is recorded. Clicking on a notification opens a modal window displaying the details of that sale.

To use the notification system, you need to create a table in your DB with the desired structure. You must provide the following mandatory fields:

+ NotificationId
+ SaleNumber (To consult the details of that sale)
+ A message to display on the card

You can also choose to include a date to be displayed on the card. In any case, you can modify everything you want in: *Domain -> Implementation -> NotificationService.cs*, the service is called in *HomeController.cs* and the JavaScript code that initialize it is on: *GoSales -> wwwroot -> js -> sb-admin-2.js* you can delete all this code and the button of notifications on: *GoSales -> wwwroot -> Views -> Shared -> _Layout.cshtml*  and all the system is going to work perfectly

That's pretty much it. With this you can start to work with this code. If I think there's something I forgot, I'll update this readme later.
